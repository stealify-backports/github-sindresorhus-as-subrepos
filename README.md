# github-sindresorhus-as-subrepos
This is a special case we take all repos from that org as monorepo to apply patches faster

It is one of the biggest ECMAScript CodeBases in the Ecosystem from a fulltime openSourcCreator.

But he has not time to adjust everything for Stealify and we did not Educate him about that also he has his own opinions which are correct out of his view.

## @Contributor
If you want to contribute to any of the packages here and not in the upstream https://github.com/sindresorhus/<repo-name> Repository simply Create a Issue and a Pull Request here we backport any usefull changes to the Original Repo if he or his Maintainance Squad wants them.

### Importent skip the Maintainer Section 
it could get confusing for you as we use some Advanced Repo Management that is Transperent so you do not need to mess with that you will see nothing only maybe a small hidden extra file ```.gitrepo``` this will never get pushed back to upstream also you will never mess with that file if your not a Maintainer!

## @Maintainer
see: https://github.com/stealify-backports/stealify-backports for docs how to work with this repo.

## @sindresorhus
If you read this and you find this we would love to get a star from you. Your also always Invited to merge everything here and take over ownership for you the BSL does not apply your ```"honoris causa"``` Member for life time.
